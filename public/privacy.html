        <p class=""> VoluntYOU is a platform that brings volunteers, NGOs, and schools together, making the
          volunteering process easy and accessible to all. When you use our services, you'll be required to share some
          of
          your personal information with us. We believe your data privacy matters - that's why we've written our privacy

        <h2 style="color: #FD765F">Information we collect</h2>
        <p>VoluntYOU only collects the information you enter into the application. If you are a volunteer, this

        </ul>

        <h2 style="color: #FDC15A">How we use your information</h2>
        <p>We use the Firebase service from Google LLC. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA) as a
          backed storage service and to derive application analytics. We use that information to see how users
          interact
          with our app.</p>

        <p>Firebase is part of the Google Cloud Platform and offers numerous services for developers. A list can be
          found
          <a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms/">on this page</a>. Some Firebase services process personal data.
          This data does not represent personally identifiable information for us. This aggregated data is used to
          analyze
          and optimize our users experience.
        </p>

        <p>Currently, we use the following Firebase services:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Google Analytics for Firebase: Google Analytics provides analytics and attribution information. You can
            find
            more information via <a href="https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/6318039">this link</a>. and on
            Google’s partner policy. Google Analytics retains ID-associated data for 60 days and retains aggregate
            reporting and campaign data without automatic renewal unless the Firebase customer changes their retention
            preference in their Analytics settings, Google uses not only the “Instance ID” described but also the
            advertising ID of the end device. You can restrict the use of the advertising ID in the device settings of
            your mobile device. For iOS: Settings > Privacy > Advertising > No ad tracking. VoluntYOU is an ad-free
            platform so this advertising ID remains unsued when you subscribe to our services.</li>
          <li>Firebase Database: Firebase Database is a hosting and backend service provided by Google Inc: it stores
            the
            data VoluntYOU collects. This data is processed in the United States. For more information please visit <a
              href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">their Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For information on how Google complies with international privacy law, please visit <a
